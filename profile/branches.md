# Creating Branches
There are two ways to create branches:
- Through GitHub Desktop/other version control [HowTo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches-in-github-desktop) 
- In GitHub [HowTo](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)

## Naming Conventions
Naming conventions donâ€™t need to be the standard across all teams. It's important to maintain consistency within each team for naming conventions, so ensure a standard is created and met.
- `Feature-Feature_Name` for each new feature you are working on. 
- `BugFix-Bug_Name` for each new bugfix branch.
