# Merge Conflicts
## How to Resolve
1. When in doubt about what to do, ask others for help.
2. Merge coflicts are often the result of auto-generated files. If the files are not the scene binary file, a `.prefab` or a `.cs` file, you can often utilize the version from `origin` or `local` with little problem. Once again, ask for help if unsure.
3. If the merge conflict is contained within a code file `.cs` or other text file extension, files can be parsed line by line. Within almost any IDE or text editor such as [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can accept changes from one branch, combine, or accept neither.
