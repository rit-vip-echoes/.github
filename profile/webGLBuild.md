# Building to WebGL
## How To
1. Ensure WebGL Build Support is installed to Unity.
  
2. [Legacy Build (pre 6.0)](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.1/Documentation/Manual/webgl-building.html)
  
3. Select `WebGL` from build options. Switch to the `WebGL` Platform.

4. Select `Build` or `Build and Run`.
   
5. Ensure the Build Path is under the `docs` folder within the repository if the build is intended to be pushed.
   
6. Wait.......
    
7. If `Build and Run` was selected, the game should pop up to be tested when the build is finished.
    
8. Otherwise, [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) from VS-Code can be used to run the index.html file on a local server to test the build.

## Common Issues
WebGL can have tons of problems building and running a build.
