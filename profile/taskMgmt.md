# Overview
Keeping track of progress, planning and managing deadlines, and documentation will be handled in 3 key areas.

- Projects handles the tracking of tasks, deadlines and sprint planning.
- A repository Wiki page will store technical documentation related to the architecture and execution of the game right in the repository for easy access.
- A GDD document will store information related to the actual design of the game, as well as meeting notes and playtest feedback.

# Sprint Planning
Before each sprint, teams will plan out a set of features and tasks related to a sprint goal, based on a project backlog. The backlog is a cumulation of higher level tasks that are known to be needed. These broader tasks inform the additions/refinments to the task board each sprint.

Features/tasks added to the current sprint should be detailed and actionable. If a task is not yet actionable, not enough information is known and instead a task to research should be used. 

# Projects
Task managment will be undertaken through Github [Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects). 

## Setup
### Sprints
Sprints will need to be setup to allow for the proper per sprint views of tasks. These are setup externally to the project inside of the repository.

4. Then fill out the needed information. Information needed varys depending on issue type.
5. Add additional organizational information to each task.

   - Assignee : Person(s) working on the task.
   - Label(optional) : Additional label to assist with high level task understanding (ie. `enhancement`)
   - Milestone: Select the Milestone this task should go under. `None` is ok if the task is not yet ready for a sprint.
