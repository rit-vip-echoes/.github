# Version Control
## Software
[Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) is the recommended way to manage version control. If comfortable with another approach, use it. 

## Setup
1. Make sure you are part of the _echoes_ organization. The organization access should give the ability to push to the repositories.
2. Clone the repository for the game(s).
4. Ensure proper Unity version is installed and can open the cloned Unity project.
5. Read the indexed documentation for further information.
