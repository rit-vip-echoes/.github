Make a pull request when you’ve finished a feature to the point that it’s ready to be added to the game/shown off in a build demo. (It doesn’t necessarily have to be finished, to be clear, just working well enough that it doesn’t break the game. Leads should be clear about when a pull request is needed vs. not!)

For people approving pull requests (usually a lead + one other person, though some teams might just have the lead approving pull requests), try not to have console errors or game-breaking bugs in code that’s pulled into the dev branch.

For pull request documentation, a somewhat detailed overview of the addition and the reasoning for said addition should go in the game’s project documentation. The pull request itself should also have documentation of what the feature is and how to test it, along with a link to the devlog.

By default, all *echoes* repos use [pull_request_template.md](https://github.com/rit-vip-echoes/.github/tree/main/.github/pull_request_template.md) as the pull request information template.
